Hey 👋 there! So, you might ask... what's this "blog" all about..? for which my answer will be, I don't know! 🤔 I think of this as a place/playground for testing/experimenting with various ideas (especially those that have digital <—> art combination... or the cross-section on of them). The ingredients, so far, is [[50% twitter, 30% notepad, 20% decentralised blog]] with an open-source flavor 👌🏾 (the notepad part is an idea that I forked from Sir Matuschak). These ingredients might change — for finding the perfect recipe (or a one that I enjoy preparing and/or Eating).
