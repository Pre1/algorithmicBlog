This Cup is dedicated to the Alone time ~= [[1]].






You and I might get along <-> you agree that pressing pause every now and then to give ourselves some space to reflect / (re|un)wind and think (or no think?) which's I believe is a healthy thing for - both - you and me.
[[following the logic? hmmm getting there. how about now]]


Switching instruments for 8 bit, imagine listening to a song which has a single note, low tempo instead of up tempo and with a certain pace (with no counter melody beneath it..) [[yep.. go ahead, I'll wait.]]


Sea..? hmmm I don't know about you, but you get bored after 3rd or 4th play... right? Now, let's put the same song into an album which has a certain theme or a story arc — 
then, all of sudden, that same song became very interesting to hear. Fuck, I'll put the whole album on repeat just for that song to play... [[yep it's that good]].


Pondering on it right now.. I think a great global composition > a perfect local composition. [[I don't know if the logic there will evaluate to true — we'll see]]
