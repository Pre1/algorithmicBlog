ðŸŽ· Music played during the cup making: Storyteller â€“ Ryan Stewart ðŸŽ·

This cup is dedicated to dreaming... you know the kind you get from a deep sleep.. or shall we say, accessing the REM state.

Before I get into my story, for a sake of a friend and someone I respect I'll substitute the word dream with the word Portal and 
each of these portals have associated color which corresponds to whether it's a good or bad dream. And if there's no color attached then it'll default to a dream â€”â€” a good one. So, to put it in a simple equation, for clarity:

	[Green | Purple] Portal -> Dream
	{Red | Black} Portal -> Nightmare

...

		[Behind the scenes I took a nap ðŸ’¤. Moving forward...]

ðŸŽ· Music played during the cup making: The Martian â€“ Hexadecimal ðŸŽ·

One of these Portals, as the chief explorer officer for planet earth (yep... even in my portals I'm the CXO...). I find out that there's a potential life in Mars. So I assembled a team of advanced robots ðŸ¤–... 

		[how advance, you ask? hmmm very advanced, trust me I have seen a lot robots...]

The mission was simple: Upon landing on Mars, simulate a civilisation with a specified time-frame â€” observe and reflect whether it's sustainable or not. Simple but not so easy on the executing dimension. Oh forget to mention something, those "advanced" robots was operating on a different numerical system than US... they were using a base-12, Ã† for short. (four for-each hand...) 

		[the maker of those robots has a very good sense of humour, you see...]

Exit the portal -> woke-up.

Side Note:

These Cup(s) might have some scratch(s) / crack(s) here and there... So I might go back to them and fix them.
