Any idiot can write a piece of code that's semantically and syntactically correct for a machine to understand / compiled. But it takes good care and empathy to write a code that target both the **Human** (yeah with capital `H`) and the machine; for clarity and understanding. To a machine, it's a set of tokens organized in a certain way... So, adding spaces ( or lines), for example, doesn't have a "meaningful" impact for a machine unlike you the dear reader ‚Äî the human. That's, for me, what distinguish a good (average) from a great programmer.
Plus, when some one ask me what's code "refactoring" to you? the first thing that come to my mind is writing (and re-writing) a code for a human to understand!

So to put it in a one-liner (naval style, hmmm one second I'll grab something... there ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è): 

		Code Kiazen ‚Äî Optimized for Human-first understating.


		
Side Note:

These Cup(s) might have some scratch(s) / crack(s) here and there... So I might go back to them and fix them.
