This cup is dedicated to , the (Art) of, coding.

Any idiot can write a piece of code that's semantically and syntactically correct for a machine to understand / compiled. But it takes good care and empathy to write a code that target both the machine and the **Human** (yeah with capital `H`) for clarity and understanding. That's, for me, what distinguish a good (average) from a great programmer.
Plus, when some one ask me what's code "refactoring" to you? the first thing that come to my mind is writing (and re-writing) a code for a human to understand!

So to put it in a one-liner (naval style, hmmm one second I'll grab something... there ™️):

Side Note:

These Cup(s) might have some scratch(s) / crack(s) here and there... So I might go back to them and fix them.
